A cross-platform tool/library allowing to inject python code into a running python process.
Based on [kmaork/pyinjector](https://github.com/kmaork/pyinjector).

If you are trying to debug a python process, check out [kmaork/madbg](https://github.com/kmaork/madbg).

### Installation
```shell script
pip install hypno
```
Both source distributions, manylinux, musslinux and windows wheels are uploaded to pypi for every release.

### Usage
#### CLI
```shell script
hypno <pid> <python_code>
```

#### API
```python
from hypno import inject_py

inject_py(pid, python_code)
```

#### Example
This example runs a python program that prints its pid, and then attaches to the newly created process and
injects it with another print statement using hypno.
```shell script
python -c "import os, time; print('Hello from', os.getpid()); time.sleep(0.5)" &\
hypno $! "import os; print('Hello again from', os.getpid())"
```

### Security
Hypno briefly generates a temporary file containing the requested python code.
This file is given 644 permissions by default, which means all users can read it.
To use custom permissions, you can pass the `permissions` argument to `inject_py()`.
